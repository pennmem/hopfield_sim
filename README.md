## Notes on operation:
* The import folder/image feature is buggy. Placing new images in the
    `images` folder, and restarting the program, is the safest way
    to add new images.
* Using image sizes greater than about 90 x 90 can cause poor performance

## NB:
* Importing images might not work as specified in the settings menu. 
    However, you can definitely add new images to the `images` folder,
    and they will be added to the image library on startup.
